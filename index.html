      image: "Icons/Eury-face.png",
      story: "“Happy Birthday Eury!, today marks your 365th Year Alive....” she whispers to herself \"how i long to be set free..\"\n\nEury was born to a mother who feared loss more than consequence. In a world bound by fragile lives and fleeting years, she sought certainty—something eternal to protect what she loved most. And so she prayed to the God of Mortality, not for wisdom, but for preservation.\n\nJiapetus, The God of Mortality didn't refuse, but warned her mother: “This child walks a path against her decision, If there comes a day where she gets tired of this monotonous world, would you be there to support her withdrawal?”\n\nEven with Jiapetus' judgement, Her mother did not hesitate. She pushed the gift of immortality to Eurelia, her own daughter, as it was the most beautiful gift she can gift to her own kin\n\nTo her, immortality was the most beautiful gift one could offer—a life unbroken, untouched by decay. She believed eternity was mercy. She believed time itself was cruelty.\n\nShe was young too know what was bestowed upon her, nor was she aware. The face of her mother when she was in her deathbed as she told her this- \"Live a life, and live it fully, Embrace forever. If you ever look back and hate me for my decision, we can meet again when you successfully revoked your blessing, tell me your stories, and if we never meet again? then you're welcome, i knew blessing you was the right choice\"\n\nYears passed. Friends withered. Seasons repeated. Faces changed, then vanished entirely. Eury remained—unchanging, untouched, forever arriving at tomorrows she did not ask for.\n\nShe tried to live well. She tried to be kind. There was nothing to look forward to, nothing to regret. She waited for meaning to reveal itself. But salvation never came.\n\nThere was no final rest. No release. No reckoning that would close the story and grant it purpose. Each year stacked upon the last, indistinguishable and endless. She watches everyone she knew come and go, maybe with a little jealousy, Oh! how she wishes to feel that release too..\n\nEury learned that death was not a curse of the mortal world, It was its salvation. and so she chose to seek the God who had granted her eternity—not in anger, but in resolve.\n\n\"I'm sorry mother, but the life i had was enough. Death is the Salvation of this mortal world, I will face the God who bestowed this gift and end it all.  I will end my chapter.\"\n\n\"Let us meet again, i have so much stories to tell you ma.\"",

      story: "“Another day, another distraction—\nDon’t let it get to you.\nDon’t let it get to you.”\n\nPocholo lived a simple life on paper. An astute businessman, sharp in thought and quicker in decision, he believed success was earned by staying ahead—by never looking back. All his decisions, to gain him the upper hand. And so, when he was lent a hand from the Gods, he wouldn't be foolish enough to reject that.\n\nAnd so Jiapetus, The God of Mortality bestowed him these words: “You shall walk endlessly forward. And your past shall trail behind you, voiceless yet ever-present. \n\nThe echoes of your choices will follow, but never touch you. Hear them if you must— but do not let them stop you.”\n\nAnd so Pocholo was made undying.\n\nYet immortality did not erase his past—it preserved it. the past when he deceived his way to the top. when he took all the merit away from his business partner, it was to get ahead. Always was,  always has been.\n\nEvery failure and every wrong decision trails his mind. whispering just beyond reach. The voices could not harm him, could not alter his path, but they followed. They persist as long as Pocholo exists and he knew that. \n\n“Don’t let it get to you,” he would say, louder each time.\n\nHe continued to thrive. His decisions grew colder, cleaner, sharper. After all—nothing held him back. Not guilt. Not grief. Not memory. Or so he believed.\n\nBut what is a life without reckoning? \nWhat is eternity when the past is never faced, only outrun?\nThe echoes never faded. They multiplied.\n\nAnd for the first time, Pocholo wondered whether immortality was not freedom—but avoidance given infinite time.\n\n\"I've lived a long life, and witnessed every loss.\nYet why are the echoes of my wins inaudible amidst the cacophonies of which i've done wrong?\n\n\"In this forever-locked room, the silence remains loud, And regret bounces off it's walls. Perhaps, it's time to let down these walls and face what's outside.\"",

      subtitle: "The Fairklord Name Eternal",
      characterName: "Ethos",

      story: "“Fairklord—we were once geniuses, I tell you.\nAnd the name will last forever with me…\nI tell myself that—\nBut no one remembers my name.”\n\nThe Fairklord name was once synonymous with brilliance. Inventors without equal, architects of weapons both magnificence and devastation, their creations reshaped battlefields. Explosives that could end wars in moments—that was the handiwork of Ethos Fairklord. \n\nYet invention moved faster than memory, His designs were replicated, refined, surpassed. His name faded from schematics, replaced by newer signatures, cleaner marks. What endured were the tools—not the hands that forged them. The Fairklord name remained, but it became diluted, spoken as history rather than honor.\n\nEthos could not accept this, so he sought the God that can preserve his name, his story.\n\nAnd so Jiapetus, The God of Mortality bestowed him these words: “The creator will die just like their creations do,\nWe live to tell tales of what was past, \nbut if you insist to stay eternal, i would not stop you, \nthough tell me this:\nwould you not be contempt to know you were a part of something grand? or would you rather chase eternally to be the meaning of grand itself?”\n\nHe believed time would vindicate him. That centuries would solidify his worth. That living longer meant being remembered longer.\n\nBut eternity does not preserve value—it erodes it.\n\nEthos lived to see his inventions become commonplace. He was great, but great alone cannot compete against the aspirations of young minds. He was the blueprint, he cannot accept that. Ethos kept honing, he kept watching as the world shifted and greatness gets passed. In a world where everyone could leave something behind, nothing stayed precious. Greatness became renewable. Legacy became noise.\n\nAnd Ethos, eternal and irrelevant, finally understood:\n\"To live forever was not to secure value— it was to watch it decay.\nIf only i left it all behind in the place knowing that if i kept chasing to find better, then i will find nothing.. The world continues to evolve, no one can be great forever\"",

      story: "\"Do you know there exists a jellyfish that is immortal?— For she has already shut her eyes, shut her eyes, shut her future and dare not gaze back, hence she lives a life with no direction. Eyes shut to ward off what has been and what will be. Because once you trade your heart for that of this fish, monotony is forever and the future gets dim.\" , as she recounts her story to the little sea creatures surrounding her\n\nEpsilese grew with the ocean as her cradle and silence as her sky.\nHer companions were not voices, nor faces, but drifting forms—\ntwo immortal jellyfishes she named Turri and Topsis.\n\nThey could not speak.\nThey could not understand her thoughts.\nYet they stayed. \n\nPart of her didn't want to outlive them, they probably don't have the same reasoning capacity as she does, still, they were her family. When she proposed to Jiapetus to become one of them, become an immortal, and to trade her heart with one of these fishes.\n\nThe God of Mortality didn't refuse but questioned her judgement: “At least you will not be alone, But you lost all reason. What good would you get sticking by these mindless Jellyfishes all your life? what future do you have if you don't ride the waves and witness the world beyond them?”\n\nShe understood that if she really wanted this life, The sea will be her forever. Regardless, her judgement clouded her, she doesn't want to ever leave her home. and so her heart beats no longer as it once did. Time stopped urging her forward, curiosity dulled, fear softened.\n\nThis is her life now, there's no looking back. \"This is it, forever. This is my choice.\" and so she shut her eyes to not look back, and to not look forward. what matters is now.\n\nDays passed without distinction.\nSo did years.\nShe watched coral bloom and rot.\nShe watched Turri divide, then divide again.\nShe watched Topsis pulse endlessly—never aging, never arriving.\n\nAnd one day, she realized something terrifying, Nothing was wrong, There was no pain, no longing, no loss sharp enough to wound her. Life has become dull, As Turri and Topsis continue to live forever, such was their fate. But for mortals like her who can think and reason... is there not a horizon out there devoid of this monotony?\n\nShe had shut her eyes so tightly that even the future could no longer knock. She cannot see what was in front of her. She doesn't know what's out there or what was. All she knew is she made the decision to make the sea her home forever. She forgot what a choice felt like, and she realized she's not one of them, not meant to live forever in monotony.\n\nShe took a moment, and opened her eyes \"It's empty, the future is empty. This is my forever. I long past the sea but i never sought to look past it. Jiapetus... Turri, Topsis.... I guess you'll outlive me after all\"\n\"Yes, I'll open my eyes again, even if it means revoking my desire for forever, in exchange, we'll see the horizons out there, and I'll continue to tell you stories about the world out there\"",

      image: "Icons/Hedler-Face.png",
      story: "\"Let me be your beacon— The light that keeps you going. Yet light only serves in the dark— if it's not? It's an afterthought.\"\n\nHedler was once an apprentice who believed guidance was salvation. While under his master's guidance, he learned that light existed to lead the lost, to stand where others could not. When the offer of immortality came, it was framed as duty— a necessary sacrifice to shine forever. Trusting his master’s will, Hedler surrendered his mortality without protest.\n\nJiapetus, The God of Mortality bestowed him these words: \"You shall be the Beacon that guides people and nothing more, Let the moths not flyeth close to thee, or they may never soar another day, Be their guide and nothing more.\"\n\nWhat this entailed to him, is that he was cursed to be a \"lightkeeper\", anyone who gets close to him shall be burnt away— shortly after, this included his master.\n\nThe alluring light draws you near, he is of course, a light that charms anyone who needs guidance. Since then, Hedler has stood alone, watched by countless eyes yet untouched by any hand. Mortals are drawn to him in moments of despair, mistaking his glow for refuge. He leads them safely through the dark without uttering a word. Each departure leaves him more fulfilled yet somehow.... emptier.\n\nWho does a beacon turn to when it begins to flicker?—Must they burn away and leave more sorrow?\n\nHedler closed his eyes— not to rest, but to endure. If he could no longer look upon those who would be harmed by his light, perhaps the pain would dull. He waits for the day his radiance fades, when the flame that defines him finally dims, Perhaps it is selfish to long for intimacy, regardless...\n\n\"My eyes are shut— i will no longer look, and when the time comes when the beacon runs dim. they will look no more, and burn no longer.\"",

      story: "\"Jiapetus.. Protect me..\", these are the words muttered by him as a blood-stained knife is hurling towards his face.\n\nKeyser was raised from an orphanage only by name. With how it's run, everyday becomes the survival of the fittest against the other children of the house. They were trained warriors, deemed weak enough and you're slaughtered and left for dead. Alas, that was the truth in the House of Freude.\n\nWhen the knife was about to hit him a golden light stepped in and protected him from all harm. and with that a grin was set on the Warden's face. he turned but took note of that.\n\nJiapetus, The God of Mortality talked to Keyser and told him this: “From this day onward, you are to survive any dangers of this cruel house and live to be fittest by your warden's standards. Do what you must to throw this place upright. Do what you must to see this place end the suffering of it's children”\n\nKeyser upon acknowledging the immortality stood idly by, watching the blood of other children die by his side... \"that could've been you, that should've been you\" whispered Warden Schaden to his ear. even the ones who work to be the fittest can only go so far.\n\n\"Oh how you've doomed these children\"\n\nKeyser knew what has to be done, he's the only one who can stand up to the warden, but he felt scared, and he felt safe knowing that he'll be the only one to leave it alive.\n\nAnd so he watched.\n\nHe watched children beg.\nHe watched children break.\nHe watched children die.\n\nAnd the world did not correct him. \n\nThe Warden knew he was a powerful weapon, so he gave the knife to him to end the last living orphan. \"All the blood was in your hands all along, you were weak and you should have died long ago, show that you are worthy of the death you've caused, show everyone you really were the fittest\"\n\nHe took the Knife, he stabbed it right into the Warden's chest, and with it, marks the end of The House of Freude. With relief, he sat down thinking to himself: \"If i had the power to change it all from the start, why didn't i?, Are all the lives lost in this house all my fault?\"\n\nThe other orphan looks at him, thankfully. The house changed him. He wanted to be proven strong. With a clouded mind and hate for what the system stood for, He chucked the knife to the chest of the remaining orphan and left the house for good. Nothing left behind, nothing to do with the fall of the house, that was the legacy of Keyser.\n\nWhen looking back at the home he grew up on, mayhaps his final act was to prove himself instead of the right thing Jiapetus wanted him to do. \"As long as i can run away forever, i would. This blessing allows for that. Thank you, but i think i need to witness the real world now.\"",
